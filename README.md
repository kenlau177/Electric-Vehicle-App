# Electric Vehicle Simulation

As part of UBCâ€™s goal to reduce GHG emissions, UBC is committed to promoting the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) for both operational and public usage. UBC fleet manages several electric vehicles and operates their charging infrastructure. In order to better understand the usage patterns of the assigned users and the demand for further development of the infrastructure, we have explored the log data of charging stations.

Although I cannot share publicly the full report, data, or code, I obtained permissions to show parts of the report and most of the code focusing mostly on the methodology. In addition, I have created a simulation in javascript and processing depicting the traffic intensity of vehicles. See here: kenlau177.github.io/Electrive-Vehicle-App
